# Udacity Bikshare Project
This project looks at data from three bike share systems; Chicago, New York City, and Washington DC. The code is written to import data and answer questions and provide descriptive statistics based off user filters. The code takes user input and creates a interactive experience. It uses three time filters; month, day of week, or no time filter.
