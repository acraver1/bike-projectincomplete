# bikeshare-project
This project looks at data from three bike share systems; Chicago, New York City, and Washington DC. The code is written to import data and answer questions and provide descriptive statistics. The code takes user input and creates a interactive experience. It uses three time filters; month, day of week, or no time filter.
